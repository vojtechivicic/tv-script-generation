# TV Script Generation
Pytorch implementation of **Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM)** for generation of new Seinfeld TV scripts. The network is trained on scripts from [Seinfeld dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv).

This project is the fourth assigment for [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101).

### Example Generated Script
(More generated scripts can be found in the `'generated scripts'` folder.)
```
jerry: the police? the police have been in there?

kramer: yeah, yeah. i mean, the only thing we got in there for a while, they have to wait.

elaine: oh, i just said it was a little nervous but it's not you. you know, i got a problem.

george: what do you want to do this guy in the pool?
